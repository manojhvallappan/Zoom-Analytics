Ideas for ZOOM Analytics

Login/Logout Tracking automatically records when students join and leave the session, making it easy to track attendance, though it doesnâ€™t confirm if students are actively engaged during the class.
Time Spent Monitoring tracks how long students remain active during a session, helping identify those who might not stay the entire time, but it cannot determine their level of participation.
Attendance via Polls requires students to respond to a quick question or survey at the start or end of the session, making it a fun way to confirm attendance, but it depends on students responding promptly to be counted.
Learning Management Systems (LMS) like Google Classroom or Moodle can automatically record attendance and track participation, offering a detailed and centralized solution, although it may require some initial setup and familiarity with the platform.
Geotagging (Optional) can verify that students are logging in from approved locations such as home or school, adding an extra layer of security but raising privacy concerns and requiring location-enabled devices.
Email or Form Submission allows students to mark their attendance by filling out a timestamped Google Form or similar tool, which ensures accuracy but relies entirely on students remembering to complete it.
